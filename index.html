            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="marked">The Arcades</span> is a small Minecraft
                minigames server made differently from what you're used to play.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm getting closer to a complete redesign from scratch of
                everything on the server, offering a game design so different
                and flexible, to let development be open and inspiring for:
                (also big) new ideas & integrations through the main system and
                other games also made by me.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the work of a single person sometime helped by his
                friends, that built and developed almost everything on the
                server:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Inspired by Hypixel's magnitude and the Roblox idea to serve
                    a vast variety of contents, in a built-in catalog interface;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Powered by the desire of making something that's not just
                    entertainment;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using every Minecraft 1.8 available asset like titles,
                    heads, entities, and tricks with blocks or other assets to
                    achieve a different result.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This server is running on Minecraft version 1.8.8, as it is the
                best version for minigames: it is equipped with enough assets,
                and due to the old combat system that is preferred by the
                players in pvp minigames.
            </p>

            <p>I'm not searching for staff members.</p>

            <h2>Incomplete</h2>
            <p>
                This project requires a huge amount of time and resources!<br />
                I'm working on this since
                <span class="marked">May 2023</span> and it's still really far from
                being a playable server!
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm constantly improving the server base I called
                <span class="marked">Server Core</span>. It's the Main Plugin
                that handles and connect everything together. Althought I'm
                changing this base so often that brakes the entire server and
                the minigames. This discourages me to complete a minigame
                development, before being sure the base has everything I need
                and, it's all well made to allow future ideas/changes or issues.
            </p>

            <h2>Games available</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>PaintBall</h3>
                    <img src="images/paintball.jpg">

                        Catch all the enemy players to take off their lives.
                        Or win being the team with more lives when the time runs out.</p>
